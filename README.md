# Useless Box Project
## Hero Shot of Final Product
## Concept 
The **Useless Box** is a playful and interactive toy box that reacts to the outer movements. As its core, the toy box takes **defense mechanisms**, preventing any attempts to turn on the LED that is attached to the lid of the box. This can be achieved through a combination of mechanical movement, motion sensing, sound effects that make the interaction almost feel like a playful battle between human and machine.\
The concept builds on the idea of **unpredictability and persistence**. The endless loop of interaction makes the user feel challenged, entertained, and curious to see what happens next. Hence, the toy box is more than just a simple gadget but an engaging experience that showcases **human-machine interactions** in a fun way.
## Features

* Playful and unpredictable reactions
* Endless loop of interaction between human and machine
## Process of idea realization
### Plan and design
* Define the overall structure and components needed
* Sketch a design layout, including the placement of the arm, lid mechanism, and movement system.Â
